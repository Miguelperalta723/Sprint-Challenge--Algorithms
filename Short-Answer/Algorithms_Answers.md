#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) the bigger n is the longer the loop takes to complete.


b)O(n log n) the first loop runs n times, the nested loop runs as long as j * 2 is less than n

c) o(n) o(2n) the loop will run 2 times of what n is.

## Exercise II

O(log n) sounds to me like a i need to do is a binary search. divide all n floors by 2 and see if egg breaks, if it does divide n floors below by 2 or if it doesnt break divide n floors above by 2. and repeat until f floor is found.
